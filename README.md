## ✨ Features

### 📊 Interactive GUI
A Tkinter-based GUI that showcases:

- **The CNN Structure**:
  - Input, Convolutional, Pooling, and Fully Connected layers.
- **Real-Time Training Metrics**:
  - **Loss** and **Accuracy** graphs that update dynamically.
- **Dynamic Weight Visualization**:
  - Connections are color-coded to represent weight strength after each epoch.

## 🛠 Comprehensive CNN Architecture

1. **Convolutional Layer**: Extracts spatial features from the input using filters.  

2. **MaxPooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions while retaining the most important features.  

3. **Fully Connected Layer**: Maps high-level features to class probabilities.
4.

## 📂 Dataset
A collection of labeled images, classified into two categories:
- **Glasses**
- **No-Glasses**

## 📌 Customizable
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning rate
  - Number of epochs
- **Network Layers**:
  - Easily modify the number of filters, pooling size, and fully connected neurons.
