ðŸ“· CNN Visualization for Glasses Classification



A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project to classify images of glasses vs. no-glasses with a real-time visualization interface.
âœ¨ Features
Interactive GUI:
A Tkinter-based GUI displays:

The CNN structure: Input, Convolutional, Pooling, and Fully Connected layers.
Real-time training metrics: Loss and Accuracy.
Dynamic weight visualization: Color-coded updates for weights after every epoch.
Comprehensive CNN Architecture:

Convolutional Layer: Extracts spatial features.
MaxPooling Layer: Reduces spatial dimensions.
Fully Connected Layer: Maps features to classification probabilities.
Dataset:
A collection of labeled images classified into two categories:

Glasses
No-Glasses
Customizable:

Hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs).
Network layers and structure.
